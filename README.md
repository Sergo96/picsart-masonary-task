# Project Overview

This project is a modern web application built with **React** and **Vite**, optimized for performance and scalability. Below is a detailed breakdown of the technologies used and the design decisions made to ensure a high-quality application.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v22 or above)
- **Yarn** (or npm, though commands are provided for Yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Build the project for production:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

## Key Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation build tool known for its fast development server and optimized build process.
- **Yarn**: A reliable package manager for JavaScript projects.
- **React Query**: A powerful library for managing server state in React applications.

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Vite?
- Lightning-fast development server.
- Instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR).
- Optimized build for production.

### Why React Query?
- Simplifies data fetching, caching, and state management.
- Improves developer productivity with built-in tools for managing server state.

## Performance Optimization

### Architecture
- **Submodule Architecture**: The codebase is organized into modular submodules, each handling a specific feature or functionality, improving maintainability and scalability.

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Image Optimization**
   - `srcSet` for responsive images to reduce bandwidth usage.
   - Lazy loading to defer non-critical images for faster initial load times.

2. **Virtualized Grid**
   - Efficiently handles large datasets by rendering only visible parts of the grid.

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Leveraging React Pages to split code by route, reducing the initial bundle size and improving load times.

4. **React Hooks**
   - `useCallback` and `useMemo` are used to prevent unnecessary re-renders, optimizing component performance.

---

## Ensuring Performance

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Comprehensive tests to catch bugs early in the development process.

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Tools are used to identify bottlenecks and ensure the application performs well under various conditions.

3. **Lighthouse Audits**
   - Regularly run audits to maintain high performance, accessibility, and SEO scores.

## Conclusion

This project combines modern tools and thoughtful design decisions to deliver a performant and scalable web application. By leveraging technologies like React, Vite, and React Query, along with performance-focused optimizations, this application provides a seamless user experience and a maintainable codebase.
